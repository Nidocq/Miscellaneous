This program takes a screenshot of every page of your Adobe Ditial edition book and creates screenshots.

the program Adobe digital edition is really bad. If pictures are present you are not able to use the right arrow key and therefore needs a restart. (Work around is to close the program when you are not on a page with an image, wait 10 seconds and then go back to the image page)
